"""
Unit Tests Package

Fast, isolated unit tests that test individual components in isolation.
These tests should run quickly and not depend on external systems.

Unit Test Guidelines:
- Test single units of functionality
- Mock all external dependencies
- Focus on business logic and edge cases
- Should be fast (< 100ms per test)
- No database, network, or file system dependencies
