"""
Integration Tests Package

Integration tests that verify the interaction between components
and external systems. These tests use real implementations of
external dependencies.

Integration Test Guidelines:
- Test adapter implementations with real systems
- Verify data persistence and external service calls
- Use test databases and sandboxed external services
- Test error handling and failure scenarios
- Slower than unit tests but faster than E2E tests
