"""
End-to-End Tests Package

Full system tests that verify complete user workflows through
external interfaces. These tests treat the system as a black box
and test through public APIs.

E2E Test Guidelines:
- Test complete user workflows
- Use real external interfaces (API, CLI, webhooks)
- Test with production-like data and scenarios
- Focus on user acceptance criteria
- Slowest tests - use sparingly for critical paths
