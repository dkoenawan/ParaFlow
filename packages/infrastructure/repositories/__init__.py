"""
Infrastructure Repositories Package

Contains concrete implementations of repository interfaces defined in the domain layer.
These implementations handle data persistence using various storage technologies
(databases, file systems, external APIs, etc.).

Repository implementations:
- Implement domain repository interfaces (secondary ports)
- Handle data mapping between domain objects and storage
- Manage database connections and transactions
- Provide data access abstraction
