"""
Domain Models Package

Contains domain entities, value objects, and aggregates.
These represent the core business concepts and maintain business invariants.

This follows Domain-Driven Design principles:
- Entities have identity and lifecycle
- Value objects are immutable and defined by their properties
- Aggregates maintain consistency boundaries
