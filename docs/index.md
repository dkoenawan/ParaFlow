## Project Overview

ParaFlow helps you maintain an organized PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) system by automatically scanning, updating, and reorganizing your content. While initially designed for Notion integration, ParaFlow is built to be extensible for other platforms and use cases.

### What is PARA?

PARA is a productivity method that organizes information into four categories:
- **Projects**: Things with a deadline and specific outcome
- **Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities to maintain  
- **Resources**: Topics of ongoing interest
- **Archives**: Inactive items from the other three categories

## Features (Planned)

- **Automated Scanning**: Periodically scans your workspace for changes
- **Webhook Integration**: Receives real-time updates
- **Intelligent Categorization**: Automatically moves content between PARA categories
- **Smart Organization**: Maintains consistent structure and naming conventions
- **Easy Information Extraction**: Provides streamlined access to your organized content
- **Deployable**: Can be deployed as a service to run continuously
- **Extensible**: Built to support multiple platforms beyond Notion
