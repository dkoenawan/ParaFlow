# Feature Specification: MVP Database CRUD

**Feature Branch**: `001-mvp-database-crud`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "MVP Database CRUD - The current project currently have an MVP to interact with Notion API using basic CRUD. We want to extend this functionality to be able to interact with database as well. This is to expand it so that user can: 1. Create database 2. Read database 3. Update database 4. Delete database. As part of this, we need to also be able to: 1. Create a page in a database, and RUD"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user with an existing Notion integration, I want to manage Notion databases and their pages so that I can organize and structure my content beyond basic page operations. I need to create new databases, view existing ones, modify database properties, remove databases I no longer need, and manage the pages within those databases.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have access to the system, **When** I create a new database with a title and initial properties, **Then** a new database is created in my Notion workspace with the specified configuration
2. **Given** a database exists in my Notion workspace, **When** I request to view the database, **Then** I can see the database metadata, properties, and structure
3. **Given** an existing database, **When** I modify its properties or settings, **Then** the database is updated with the new configuration
4. **Given** an existing database, **When** I delete it, **Then** the database and all its contents are removed from my Notion workspace
5. **Given** an existing database, **When** I create a new page in that database, **Then** a new page is added to the database with the specified properties
6. **Given** a page exists in a database, **When** I request to view the page, **Then** I can see the page content and property values
7. **Given** an existing page in a database, **When** I update the page properties or content, **Then** the page is modified with the new information
8. **Given** an existing page in a database, **When** I delete the page, **Then** the page is removed from the database

### Edge Cases
- What happens when attempting to create a database with invalid or missing required properties? → CRUD MVP should validate and confirm with user before creation
- How does the system handle deletion of a database that contains pages? → Double confirm with user on destructive changes
- What occurs when trying to access a database that has been deleted or moved by another user? → Alert users
- How are permission errors handled when the user lacks access to perform database operations? → Alert users to review and update API key permissions
- What happens when creating a page in a database with required properties that aren't provided? → Confirm with users

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new Notion databases with configurable properties and schema
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide the ability to retrieve and display existing database information including metadata and structure
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable users to update database properties, titles, and configuration settings
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to delete databases from their Notion workspace
- **FR-005**: System MUST support creating new pages within existing databases with appropriate property values
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide the ability to read and display pages from databases including their property values and content
- **FR-007**: System MUST enable users to update existing pages in databases, modifying both properties and content
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to delete pages from databases
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle authentication and authorization for Notion workspace access using API key authentication
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide appropriate error handling and user feedback for failed operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate database and page operations before execution to prevent invalid states

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Database**: Represents a Notion database with properties including title, schema definition, property types, and configuration settings
- **DatabasePage**: Represents a page within a database, containing property values that conform to the database schema and page content
- **DatabaseProperty**: Represents individual properties/fields within a database schema, including property type, name, and configuration options
- **User**: Represents the authenticated user who owns or has access to the Notion workspace and can perform database operations
