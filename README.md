# ParaFlow
AI-powered personal assistant that captures, processes, and organizes your thoughts into the PARA framework

## Overview

ParaFlow helps you maintain an organized PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) system by automatically scanning, updating, and reorganizing your content. While initially designed for Notion integration, ParaFlow is built to be extensible for other platforms and use cases.

## What is PARA?

PARA is a productivity method that organizes information into four categories:
- **Projects**: Things with a deadline and specific outcome
- **Areas**: Ongoing responsibilities to maintain
- **Resources**: Topics of ongoing interest
- **Archives**: Inactive items from the other three categories

## The Challenge

Maintaining a PARA system requires constant manual updates:
- Moving completed projects to archives
- Reorganizing resources as interests evolve
- Keeping area documentation current
- Ensuring easy access to relevant information

## The Solution

ParaFlow automates this process by:
- Scanning your workspace for content changes
- Receiving webhooks for real-time updates
- Automatically categorizing and reorganizing content
- Maintaining consistent structure across your PARA system
- Providing organic ways to update and extract information

## Features (Planned)

- **Automated Scanning**: Periodically scans your workspace for changes
- **Webhook Integration**: Receives real-time updates
- **Intelligent Categorization**: Automatically moves content between PARA categories
- **Smart Organization**: Maintains consistent structure and naming conventions
- **Easy Information Extraction**: Provides streamlined access to your organized content
- **Deployable**: Can be deployed as a service to run continuously
- **Extensible**: Built to support multiple platforms beyond Notion
